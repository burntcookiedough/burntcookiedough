## Selected Projects

### TorrentGuard — Secure Torrent Client with Real-Time Malware Detection
**AI-powered torrent security system (Full-stack)**

- Designed a **piece-level malware scanning pipeline** for torrents
- Scans data *during download*, not after completion
- Combined:
  - Entropy analysis
  - YARA signature matching
  - Random Forest ML model (NSL-KDD features)
- Automatically **quarantines malicious downloads**
- Real-time dashboard using **Flask + WebSockets**
- Integrated with **qBittorrent API** and mock torrent engine for testing

**Key takeaway:** Systems + security + ML working together in real time.

### Veri-Dose — Smart Pill Dispenser with On-Device AI Verification
**Edge AI + healthcare safety system**

- Built a **dual-verification system**:
  - User authentication
  - Pill image classification
- On-device ML inference (MobileNet-based)
- Designed for **privacy-first, offline operation**
- Raspberry Pi–based edge deployment
- Emphasis on **safety, reliability, and auditability**

**Key takeaway:** Edge AI + embedded systems + real-world constraints.

---

### Machine-Learning Driven QR Code Security System (IPR / Patent Disclosure)
**Serverless ML system for real-time URL risk assessment**

- Designed a **cloud-native QR security pipeline**
- Hybrid ML model (Logistic Regression + Random Forest)
- Extracts **lexical, structural, and behavioral URL features**
- Classifies URLs as:
  - Safe → direct QR
  - Suspicious → warning page
  - Dangerous → blocked page
- Built on **AWS Lambda, S3, CloudFront**
- Addressed SSRF, obfuscated URLs, punycode domains

**Key takeaway:** Security-first ML + serverless architecture.

---

### Raspberry Pi CDN
**Edge-based content delivery system**

- Built a **local CDN using Raspberry Pi nodes**
- Reduced upstream bandwidth usage by **~60%**
- Improved content access latency on local networks
- Focused on **network efficiency and edge computing**

**Key takeaway:** Practical networking and performance optimization.

---

### Fingerprint Spoofing Detection (Hackathon — Yantra 2025)
**ML-based biometric security system**

- Built during **Yantra 2025 Hackathon**
- Focused on detecting spoofed fingerprint inputs
- Achieved **Finalist position**
- Emphasis on **security robustness over accuracy chasing**

---

## Infrastructure & Deployment Highlights

- **Self-hosted GitHub Stats Service**
  - Deployed on Vercel using **Node.js serverless**
  - Debugged:
    - Edge vs Node runtime mismatch
    - Environment variable injection
    - Secure PAT handling
  - Result: Stable, self-owned production endpoint

- Automated workflows leading to:
  - **40% faster server setup**
  - **60% bandwidth reduction**

This README itself reflects **systems ownership**, not copy-paste tooling.
